## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom fonts

### What I learned

I applied the suggestions written in the original README.md file where the developer should first write HTML structure and then style the website. I did that and needed less time to create the card component.

I also applied what I learned about more complex media queries. Mainly for different paddings between mobile and desktop and different font sizes.

I applied a couple of things from the first two challenges that I did. They were CSS reset and using CSS variables.

### Continued development

At the moment, just increase the speed of creating the website, and continue learning about more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

Didn't use any specific for this challenge
